## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (Key Decisions and `<decisions>`).

v1.2 roadmap locks:

- Phases 12–16 only; continuous numbering after v1.1 Phase 11
- PIPE-01 MVP = config + validation + UI; execution → v1.3
- Live SMTP (MAIL-01) and signup confirmation mail (MAIL-02) deferred to v1.3
- ADUX preview cluster (13) before draft→ready / score_factors (14)

### Pending Todos

None. Next: `/gsd-plan-phase 12`

### Blockers/Concerns

Signup confirmation mail (`g-01-3b-signup-mailer`) remains open from v1 (not this milestone).
Nyquist VALIDATION.md drafts for phases 6–8 remain historical debt (not a v1.2 product requirement).

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| deferred_items | 10/deferred-items.md: pre-existing test_admin_shortlist_empty_batch failure → FIX-01 / Phase 12 | in_roadmap | 2026-10-02 | v1.1→v1.2 |
| debug_sessions | (4 items from v1 close — see MILESTONES.md) | acknowledged | 2026-09-22 | v1 |

Carried product deferrals to v1.3+: leaderboard, quiz, live SMTP, signup mail, Whisper/Foundry ASR, ingest HTTP/scheduler, PIPE execution.
