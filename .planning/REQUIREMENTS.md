# Requirements: Digest CDS

**Defined:** 2026-09-24
**Core Value:** Authorized СВА staff can read a trustworthy weekly issue of prepared articles and influence the next разбор through one honest vote — without treating raw video/transcript as published material.

**Milestone:** v1.1 YouTube → LLM → Supabase ingestion

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for this milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Contracts (data-collection)

- [x] **DTO-01**: Types `Transcript`, `VideoMetadata`, `MaterialDraft`, and `TemplateKind` live in `data-collection` and are covered by unit tests
- [x] **DTO-02**: Ports `TranscriptProvider` and `ArticleGenerator` have in-memory fakes usable by unit tests

### Captions

- [x] **CAP-01**: Operator can pass a YouTube URL; the CLI resolves `video_id` and fetches captions with `ru`/`en` preference
- [x] **CAP-02**: Missing, disabled, or blocked captions exit non-zero with `stage=captions` and write zero database rows

### Article generation

- [x] **LLM-01**: DeepSeek via an OpenAI-compatible SDK returns a validated `ArticleDraft` (`title`, `dek`, `body_markdown`)
- [x] **LLM-02**: Operator can choose `--template lecture|podcast` backed by repository markdown templates
- [x] **LLM-03**: LLM failures (network, 5xx, invalid JSON, validation) exit non-zero with `stage=llm`, zero database rows, and no partial output
- [x] **LLM-04**: System prompt enforces honesty — use only transcript content, no invented facts/names/numbers; output is always Russian (`ru` transcript: format only, do not translate; `en` transcript: translate to Russian). Preserve technical terms, proper names, library names, numbers, and units as written. Caller appends a translation marker to `provenance_label` when `language != "ru"`. Supersedes "output language matches the transcript language".
- [x] **LLM-05**: Transcripts that exceed the context budget fail closed with `stage=llm_truncation` and no silent truncation (chunking deferred)

### Persist and shortlist

- [x] **PERS-01**: A successful run inserts `materials` with `status=draft` only (never `ready`) and provenance fields `source_url`, `youtube_video_id`, `source_author`, `source_published_at`, `provenance_label`
- [x] **PERS-02**: The run enqueues `digest_shortlist_items` on the current unsent batch (`decision=pending`); if that batch already has 5 items, it creates a new unsent batch and enqueues there

### CLI and UAT

- [x] **CLI-01**: `ingestion-service` Typer one-shot prints `material_id`, `slug`, `batch_id`, and `rank` on success
- [ ] **CLI-02**: Re-running the same `video_id` does not create duplicate materials or shortlist rows (upsert / conflict-safe)
- [ ] **CLI-03**: UAT: 3–5 real captioned videos appear as drafts in `/admin/digest`, including at least one English source video (draft in Russian)
- [x] **CLI-04**: CLI prints staged progress (`✓ transcript` / `✓ LLM` / `✓ saved`)
- [x] **CLI-05**: `ingestion-service` has its own `.env`, separate from the backend env file

## v2 Requirements

Deferred. Not in this milestone's roadmap.

### Ingestion follow-ups

- **ING-01**: HTTP API to trigger ingestion (no CLI-only)
- **ING-02**: Scheduler / playlist or channel batch ingest
- **ING-03**: Transcription when captions are missing (FoundryModels revisit; not Whisper-on-VM)
- **ING-04**: Transcript chunking when content exceeds the context budget

### Deferred product (post-v1, not this milestone)

- **LEAD-01**: Public leaderboard (ADR-0001)
- **QUIZ-01**: Quiz cards
- **PIPE-01**: Admin YAML pipeline config UI
- **MAIL-01**: Live SMTP in place of StubMailer
- **MAIL-02**: Signup confirmation mail so self-service `/register` persists a user

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Auto-`ready`, auto-approve, auto-send | Editorial trust; admin HITL stays the publish gate |
| Raw transcript or media stored as material body | Content contract (D-CONTENT-01) |
| Silent transcript truncation | Operators must see `stage=llm_truncation`; chunking is v2 |
| Whisper / local ASR on the app VM | ADR-0002; captions-only this milestone |
| Ingestion talking to FastAPI or knowing SPA routes | Shared database is the contract; backend stays the reader |
| Backend or SPA changes required for drafts to show | Existing `/admin/digest` shortlist is the review surface |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| DTO-01 | Phase 6 | Complete |
| DTO-02 | Phase 6 | Complete |
| CAP-01 | Phase 7 | Complete |
| CAP-02 | Phase 7 | Complete |
| LLM-01 | Phase 8 | Complete |
| LLM-02 | Phase 8 | Complete |
| LLM-03 | Phase 8 | Complete |
| LLM-04 | Phase 8 | Complete |
| LLM-05 | Phase 8 | Complete |
| PERS-01 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| PERS-02 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| CLI-01 | Phase 10 | Complete |
| CLI-02 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| CLI-03 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| CLI-04 | Phase 10 | Complete |
| CLI-05 | Phase 10 | Complete |
