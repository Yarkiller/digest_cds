# Requirements: Digest CDS

**Defined:** 2026-10-02
**Core Value:** Authorized СВА staff can read a trustworthy weekly issue of prepared articles and influence the next разбор through one honest vote — without treating raw video/transcript as published material.

**Milestone:** v1.2 Admin UX + diagnostics + PIPE-01 MVP

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for this milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Admin preview & triage

- [ ] **ADUX-01**: Admin material preview on `/admin/digest` shows `body_markdown`, `provenance_label`, char/word counts, and a link to `/materials/<slug>` (not title+dek only)
- [ ] **ADUX-02**: «Превью письма» shows a real email HTML preview including intro, summaries, and links (not titles-only)
- [ ] **ADUX-03**: Interstitial connecting text preserves paragraph breaks (`\n\n` → visible whitespace / `<p>` split)
- [ ] **ADUX-04**: Leaked `test-header` (and equivalent seed/test chrome) does not appear in admin preview surfaces after cleanup
- [ ] **ADUX-05**: Admin can set material status from `draft` → `ready` in UI so send is not blocked by D-85 without SQL
- [ ] **ADUX-06**: Shortlist «Обоснование» is honest — either populated `score_factors` from pipeline config MVP or an explicit empty/unavailable state (no silent fake justification)

### Operator diagnostics

- [ ] **DBG-01**: `ingestion-service` CLI accepts `--debug` and prints richer stage diagnostics on stderr/stdout without leaking secrets, proxy credentials, cookies, or full transcript bodies
- [ ] **DBG-02**: With `--debug` off, existing staged progress / `IngestError.to_dict()` contracts remain unchanged

### Pipeline config (PIPE-01 MVP)

- [ ] **PIPE-01**: Admin can view and edit YAML (or equivalent structured) pipeline config through an admin UI
- [ ] **PIPE-02**: Pipeline config is validated before save; invalid config is rejected with field-level or structured errors (no silent accept)
- [ ] **PIPE-03**: Validated config persists and is readable on subsequent admin sessions (storage behind a port; no deep Supabase coupling in UI)

### Test debt

- [x] **FIX-01**: `tests/unit/test_http_admin.py::test_admin_shortlist_empty_batch_returns_200_empty_items` passes (schema extras / `sent_at` / `week_label` response contract aligned)

## v1.3+ Requirements

Deferred. Not in this milestone's roadmap.

### Pipeline execution

- **PIPE-EXEC-01**: Full pipeline execution driven by saved PIPE-01 config (run/trigger from admin or scheduler)
- **PIPE-EXEC-02**: Config-driven score_factors population during ingest (if not covered by MVP honesty path)

### Ingestion follow-ups

- **ING-01**: HTTP API to trigger ingestion (no CLI-only)
- **ING-02**: Scheduler / playlist or channel batch ingest
- **ING-03**: Transcription when captions are missing (FoundryModels revisit; not Whisper-on-VM)
- **ING-04**: Transcript chunking when content exceeds the context budget

### Deferred product

- **LEAD-01**: Public leaderboard (ADR-0001)
- **QUIZ-01**: Quiz cards
- **MAIL-01**: Live SMTP in place of StubMailer
- **MAIL-02**: Signup confirmation mail so self-service `/register` persists a user

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| PIPE full pipeline execution | Explicitly v1.3 — v1.2 is config + validation + UI only |
| Live SMTP / signup confirmation mail | Deferred to v1.3 (MAIL-01, MAIL-02) |
| Auto-`ready` without admin action | Editorial trust; ADUX-05 is explicit admin control |
| Whisper / local ASR on the app VM | ADR-0002; captions-only until Foundry revisit |
| Ingestion talking to FastAPI for write path | Shared database remains the ingest contract; admin UX may call backend read/write APIs for triage |
| Nyquist reconcile of archived phases 6–8 | Historical audit tech debt; not a v1.2 product requirement |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| FIX-01 | Phase 12 | Complete |
| ADUX-01 | Phase 13 | Pending |
| ADUX-02 | Phase 13 | Pending |
| ADUX-03 | Phase 13 | Pending |
| ADUX-04 | Phase 13 | Pending |
| ADUX-05 | Phase 14 | Pending |
| ADUX-06 | Phase 14 | Pending |
| DBG-01 | Phase 15 | Pending |
| DBG-02 | Phase 15 | Pending |
| PIPE-01 | Phase 16 | Pending |
| PIPE-02 | Phase 16 | Pending |
| PIPE-03 | Phase 16 | Pending |
