"""DigestPublisher port — atomic claim + publish + delivery stamp (CR-01/WR-01, D-88/D-89).

Single-transaction operation backed on live by migration 005's ``claim_and_publish_digest``
RPC. Collapses the previously-split ``ShortlistRepository.claim_sent`` + ``IssueRepository.publish``
so a publish failure can never leave a batch stamped ``sent_at`` with no issue.
